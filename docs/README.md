The Sublime Text Community Documentation 
is a community effort 
at documenting the [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com/) editor. 
It was started by [Guillermo LÃ³pez-Anglada](https://github.com/guillermooo) in 2010 
and later joined by [FichteFoll](https://github.com/FichteFoll) in 2013, 
receiving countless contributions 
by other members of the community through its entire lifetime. 
In 2014, it was backed by a fundraiser and supported 
by individuals and Sublime HQ Pty Ltd.

<!-- TODO redo -->
After the originally hosted version on http://docs.sublimetext.info/ went down 
and the maintainer of both the repo and the domain could not be contacted anymore, 
the project was rebooted under its current domain of <https://docs.sublimetext.io/>,
which is a fork of the original 
under an older, more permissive license.
