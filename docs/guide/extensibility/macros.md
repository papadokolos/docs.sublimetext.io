title: Macros
---

Macros are a basic automation facility comprising sequences of commands. Use
them whenever you need to repeat the exact same steps to perform an operation.

Macro files are JSON files with the extension `.sublime-macro`. Sublime Text
ships with a few macros providing core functionality, such as line and word
deletion. You can find these under **Tools | Macros** or in
`Packages/Default`.

## How to Record Macros

To start recording a macro, press <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+q</kbd> and subsequently execute the
desired steps one by one. When you're done, press <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+q</kbd> again to stop
the macro recorder. Your new macro won't be saved to a file, but kept in the
macro buffer instead. Now you will be able to run the recorded macro by
pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+q</kbd>, or save it to a file by selecting
**Tools | Save macro...**

Note that the macro buffer will remember only the latest recorded macro. Also,
macros only record commands sent to the buffer: window-level
commands, such creating a new file, will be ignored.

## How to Edit Macros

As an alternative to recording a macro, you can edit it by hand. Just save a new file
with the `.sublime-macro` extension under `Packages/User` and add
commands to it. Macro files have this format:

```json
[
   { "command": "move_to", "args": {"to": "hardeol"} },
   { "command": "insert", "args": {"characters": "\n"} },
]
```
See the [Commands](/reference/commands.md) section for more information on commands.

<!-- TODO do we need to escape every kind of quotations marks? -->

If you're editing a macro by hand, you need to escape quotation marks,
blank spaces and backslashes by preceding them with `\`.

### Where to Store Macros

Macro files can be stored in any package folder, and then will show up
under **Tools | Macros | \<PackageName\>**.

## Key Binding for Macros

Macro files can be bound to key combinations by passing the macro file path to the `run_macro_file` command like so:

```json
{
    "keys": ["super+alt+l"],
    "command": "run_macro_file",
    "args": {
        "file": "res://Packages/User/Example.sublime-macro"
    }
}
```
