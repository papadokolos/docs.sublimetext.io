Welcome to the community-driven documentation project
for the Sublime Text editor!

[Sublime Text][] is a versatile and fun text editor
for code and prose that automates repetitive tasks so you can focus the
important stuff. It works on OS X, Windows and Linux.

If you're starting out with Sublime Text,
start with the [Basic Concepts][] section.
Otherwise,
feel free to use the sidebar on the left
to navigate to your topic of interest.

If you're interested in the nitty-gritty details
of how you can customize and extend Sublime Text to your liking,
check out the [Reference](/reference/) section
of this guide via the navigation bar on top.
You can always go back to this page
by clicking on "Guide" in that same bar.

Happy learning!
